# Featured in CCE PAUSD Digital Showcase

**Out of 100+ students taking AP Computer Science Principles (APCSP) at my school during the 2020-2021 school year, the projects of 11 students were selected to be featured in the CCE PAUSD Digital
Showcase. And mine was one of them!**

What is this showcase? What is its significance? Don't fret because all of your questions will answered. Every year, my school district PAUSD holds a showcase of the best projects in each of the Career & Curriculum Education (CCE) classes.

During my sophmore year, one of the classes I took was APCSP. I'm really glad that I took the class because I took a lot away from it. But my view of the class was not always postive. When I came into the class, I had low expectations. I already knew how to code in text-based languages such as Python and JavaScript, so I scoffed at the thought of using <a href = "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target = "_blank">Snap</a>, a block-based programming language similar to Scratch. The only reason I was taking the class was because it was an easy AP and would set me on a path to take APSCA and then CS Capstone (which I am really excited for :).

But as the class progressed, I surprised by how much I was getting out of it. While I was strong in the technical side of computer science, programming, I had little knowledge of broader concepts such as how the internet works. Learning all of this was really fascinating and it forced me to acknowledge that I had been underappreciating this class. Thank you Mr. Bell (APSCP teacher) for giving me such a well-rounded CS education, something I definitely needed.

Now back to the showcase. It was 

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const hello = "hi"

function hi() {
    console.log(hello)
}
</code></pre>
